# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Relationship validation now answers by looking up the ArchiMate 3.2 relationship tables (Appendix B.5) instead of reasoning about element categories. `src/relationships/matrix.generated.ts` is generated from `relationships.xml` in the Archi repository and holds 3844 source-target pairs over 62 concepts; regenerate it with `node scripts/generate-matrix.mjs`. Measured over all 39,600 combinations of 60 element types and 11 relationship types, the previous implementation rejected 2,091 relationships the specification permits and accepted 6,544 it lists nowhere. The five exported functions of `src/relationships/validation.ts` are unchanged. See [docs/relationship-validation.md](docs/relationship-validation.md).
- Audit logging no longer breaks the tool it audits. The default log path is now `~/archimate-audit.ndjson` instead of `archimate-audit.ndjson` in the working directory: MCP hosts such as Claude Desktop start the server with `/` as working directory, which is read-only, so every audited tool (import, export_exchange, export_mermaid, export_diagram, export_markdown, export_html_deck) failed with `EROFS` even after its export had succeeded. A failing audit write is now reported once on stderr and otherwise ignored.

### Changed
- Dependency bumps: fast-xml-parser to ^5.10.1, sharp to ^0.35.3, uuid to ^14.0.1, vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 to ^4.1.10, @amiceli/vitest-cucumber to ^7.0.0.

### Security
- Resolved all `npm audit` findings (3 high, 6 moderate). Lockfile refresh moves sharp to 0.35.5 (libheif advisories) and the MCP SDK's transitive fast-uri, hono, qs and ip-address to patched versions; brace-expansion patched in dev tooling. vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 bumped to ^4.1.11 (path traversal in @vitest/mocker); this pulls in vite 8, which bundles with rolldown instead of esbuild/rollup.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Executable behavior specifications under `features/`. Every observable server behavior is documented as a Gherkin `.feature` file with a sibling `.feature.test.ts` binding via `@amiceli/vitest-cucumber`. Nine area files cover all 33 tools and run as part of `npm test` (289 step-level tests).
- Architecture decision records 008 (OIDC trusted publishing) and 009 (auto-draw view connections) under `docs/adr/`.
- New `src/model/impact.ts` module exporting `analyzeImpact`, extracted from the `archimate_impact_analysis` handler so callers and the spec exercise the same code path.

### Changed
- `archimate_import_exchange` (and `parseExchangeFormat`) now strictly validates Open Exchange XML before parsing. Malformed input previously returned a near-empty model silently; it now throws an error with line/column information. Callers relying on the old permissive behavior must catch and handle the error.

### Internal
- Switched the npm publish workflow to OIDC trusted publishing; the `NPM_TOKEN` secret has been removed.
- Opted JavaScript-based GitHub Actions into the Node 24 runtime to clear the deprecation warning ahead of the 2026-09-16 cutover.
- Refreshed `CLAUDE.md` release procedure to reflect the OIDC flow and the BDD update discipline.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `archimate_add_to_view` now auto-draws diagram connections for any relationship between the new element and an element already on the canvas, mirroring Archi's native drag-in behavior. Orientation matches the relationship direction and existing connections are not duplicated. The response includes an `autoConnectedRelationships` array listing every connection drawn.
- New `auto_connect` boolean parameter on `archimate_add_to_view` (default `true`) to opt out of auto-drawing.

### Changed
- Updated the description of `archimate_add_connection_to_view` to clarify that it is normally unnecessary and should only be used for manual overrides.

### Fixed
- Open Exchange Format export now emits the required `xsi:type` attributes on `view`, `node`, and `connection` elements, producing schema-valid XML.
